        <p>Some services provided by transportation companies are project management, dry van<br> transportation, refrigerated freight and intermodal transport. Distribution center-to-store<br> movements and inbound vendor pickups to distribution centers are additional services<br> some companies offer, notes BayandBay.com.</p>
        <p>Project management, also called logistics projects, extends beyond a company's need for<br> transportation. Without project management, businesses have to make many <br>arrangements with multiple carriers and vendors to get goods to their destinations on<br> time. Project management eliminates that need by having one company coordinate and <br>transport all the goods in a shipment.</p>
        <p>Dry van transportation can handle most basic transit and expedited shipping needs.<br> This includes inbound vendor pickups and center-to-store movements as well as reverse <br>distribution. If a product has a safety recall or is defective upon arrival, reverse<br> distribution ensures a company has a timely way to get the goods returned.</p>
        <p>Intermodal transport combines multiple shipping methods such as trucks and freight<br> trains. Using multiple methods of transportation through the same trucking company's<br> contracts saves time and money for the business shipping the goods, states JBHunt.com.<br> Combining cargo shipping or freight trains with truck transportation is frequently<br> necessary to deliver on time, especially to other countries.</p>
        <p>Refrigerated freight service offers temperature-controlled options for transporting food, <br>medications and other climate-sensitive freight. Companies provide climate-controlled<br> truck-trailers or intermodal containers to meet a customer's needs and comply with FDA<br> guidelines for storing and transporting perishable food products.</p>
